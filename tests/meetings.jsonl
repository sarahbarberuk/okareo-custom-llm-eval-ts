{"input": "To report at the Sustainability and Transportation Committee agenda item seven Constable 118 618 relating to the Seattle Bike Share program authorizing a partial removal of the proviso included in 2016 budget green sheet 93, Dash one, dash 80, dash one and ratifying confirming switching prior acts. The Committee recommended the full council pass as amended the Council bill with a divided report with Councilman Mr. Brian Johnson. So want and what is in favor. And councilmembers Herbold and Burgess opposed. Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. So, I mean, just give a quick overview of the legislation before us. We've had a lot of discussion on this, but I believe there's still four amendments that will be presented today. So we'll walk through those and make sure everyone has any questions addressed or concerns addressed to this legislation. Council Bill 118618 would lift the proviso that the Council placed on the money during last year's budget. As a reminder to folks in the 2016 budget, which we worked on during 2015, the mayor had originally proposed investing $5 million in expanding the bike share system that was part of a program that was going to be matched with a federal grant the application was in during the budget process. We heard back from the federal agency that that ground was not going to be awarded. And what the council did at that point was put a proviso on the $5 million, essentially saying this money stays in the budget, but it cannot be spent until you come back to council. And what we said at the time was we wanted to hear what an expansion plan for expanding a bike share system in Seattle looked like. What happened in the interim is we learned that the nonprofit Pronto, that runs the city's bike share system that was established to run this was no longer going to be solvent before the end of this month March. And so the mayor came back with this piece of legislation asking us to do a partial lift to the proviso essentially allowing him to spend the city to spend up to $1.4 million of that $5 million. And that is the legislation that's before us today. The expectation at this point is if we are to move forward, that request for proposals would be sent out in the next month or so, and we would hear back sometime this summer on what possible expansion options are available. At which point the Council would have a chance to review those and decide if we wanted to lift the proviso on the remaining $3.6 million and move forward for an expansion, which would likely happen sometime in the spring of 2017. There are well, there are a number of amendments that are listed. I believe that there are four that are going to be proposed today. And I propose going in order on our agenda is amendment number four, which was proposed by Councilmembers Burgess and Herbold to go first on that. Okay. Councilmember Burgess, thank you very much. Well, a bike sharing program, as I think all of us on the council have stated in the past, is an important and even a desired element of our public transportation network. We're faced with the reality today that the current system is insolvent and lacks the ridership, annual membership or revenue to be financially viable. In essence, the Council is being asked to invest in pronto rescue from insolvency so that a better and more financially viable service can be adopted. This is what economists call optimism bias. Despite the passionate advocacy by some in favor of this rescue, the risks of investing without a specific plan of action in hand. And we have no plan or a clear understanding of the city's financial exposure and an identification of what that exposure would be are exceedingly high. Such a rescue does not reflect, in my view, the level of care that the Council should exhibit as it exercises its fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of Seattle. The other element that we have to consider here goes more to our process and procedures. And as the Council's budget chair, I think it's my duty to point this out. Asked first learned of Toronto's financial problems in early 2015, as is reflected in the city's application for a federal Tiger grant, which was denied. The Council should have been immediately informed of this material fact, and we were not. In December of last year, one month after the Council had imposed a budget restriction in November. As time went ahead and spent $305,000 to cover pronto operations for the month of December, January and February, violating the spirit and the intent of the Council's budget proviso. I don't think the Council should ignore that kind of behavior. So based on these facts and because of the financial risk to the city, I move amendment number four, which would allow repayment of the federal grant if necessary. While maintaining excuse me, while maintaining the proviso on the remaining funds. This approach would substantially reduce the financial risk to the city and allow us to develop a public private partnership with the clear expectation that no city funding would be required for future operating revenue and that the public and private parties would appropriately share responsibility for capital expenses. I believe that is a much more prudent and wise course for us to follow. So I would move. Amendment number. Four. Has been moved in Second Amendment four as stated by Councilmember Burgess. Are there any other responses to his amendment? I'd like to speak to you. Like to supporting comment. Councilmember Herbold I'd just like to clarify some changes that were made between the committee meeting that we had where I had an amendment that was a purely it denied the proviso, but it was a supported a purely private system. Councilman Burgess made some changes that put some brackets that I thought were appropriate as relates to the city funding specified that we were minimizing this. The the program that we would like to see come forward would minimize the city investment and would recognize that potentially the full $3.6 million in funds may not be needed. And if so, they should be reprogramed into other bicycle and pedestrian safety projects. I also wanted to just underscore really the primary difference between the bills before us today are really whether or not we're just paying off Toronto's debt, we're purchasing equipment that we'll likely not keep if we want a system that's flexible, like Port Portland's coming system, which is more like a bike version of a car to go where you can leave the bike and other places don't have to return it to the sort of the the docking systems that we have for the bikes now under the pronto system. And really, for me, the question is, is do we need to pay off Toronto's debt and purchase a bunch of equipment that we likely won't want to keep in order to issue an RFP that says what we do want? It's sort of like buying a flip phone, a flip phone and paying off the flip phone company's debt in order to bid on a smart phone. Why not just go for the smart phone? This is an evolving technology, and I really think that we need to understand that when prioritizing our public resources and that so that we aren't paying for the experiment, we're paying for the 2.0 version. So that's mostly what I had to add. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. I appreciate the comments that councilmembers Burgess and Herbold brought up. I'm going to oppose this amendment. I agree with the concerns about the timing and notification of our start throughout this past six or eight months in the work. And I struggle with the same question that Councilmember Burgess identified. What do we do when a department has not lived up to our expectations? And I I've struggled with that. In the end, what I know is there are thousands of people that are members of Bikeshare and use it on a daily basis and to take away a system that is working for those folks because a start has not lived up to our expectation, I don't think is the right step forward. Rather, I believe that we've made it clear that our state needs to do a better job on this and other communications and decision making. And through amendment that was passed, the committee made it clear that the Council will play an active role in scoping the RFP and reviewing it going forward. And there's an amendment I will bring forward later to further add language to that. I believe, as I think others do, that bike share is, can be and will be an integral part of our transportation network going forward. I view it as a type of public transit that helps connect users in different ways to get around the city. I think we are at a technology and flux point and we need to learn what goes forward. But I think the best path forward at this point is to make the modest investment, at least the marginal investment, because of the grant we would have to repay if we didn't go forward to maintain the existing system, to maintain our existing users and ridership. Looking at the data from last year, the the system, according to last year's operations, which were not great, still is only $100,000 away from breaking even. And my expectations are that as and the manage the folks managing the system can boost the performance this year to make it. An actual breakeven or hopefully even a profitable operation in 2016. And it can bridge to whatever expansion looks like. And there's a real reality that the expansion in 2017 may be with similar technology as we have today. That's a technology that's very similar to what we've seen in most cities around the country. It may be that there are new technologies that come forward in a more beneficial we could learn about in the fall. That said, I appreciate the work that folks have done on this, but I think this point I will say no on this amendment and instead move to fund the buyout. Can I just. To Councilmember Beck. Show. Thank you. I have just a quick clarifying question. Councilmember Herbold, I really appreciate what you are bringing forward and especially what we can learn from the mistakes or perhaps the not fully baked plan. And I'm wondering, Councilmember O'Brien, if you can talk a little bit further about your amendment that we're going to be seeing in a few moments. How can we incorporate the essence of what Councilmember Herbold is saying in terms of expanding a program that's going to work for Seattle? So. I believe what Councilmember Herbold talked about was there's different types of systems. Portland is about to roll out a different version. It's it's new technology. We haven't really seen it on the ground at the scales. Portland are going to do going to use it. And it may be that six months from now when we get responses to the RFP that there are vendors of that type of system that want to invest in Seattle and can put forward a plan that fits within our financial constraints and is competitive. We don't know that, though, and we're not going to know that for months. The amendment number nine, which I'll speak to in a moment, highlights the fact that we are looking for ideas on how to expand the existing system with the existing technology, a system that uses electric assist bikes instead, or perhaps a hybrid of that, or a point to point bikeshare system similar to what Portland is deploying. But it leaves the door open for folks to come forward with all the offers and allow us as a city to evaluate the pros and cons and cost of all those at that time. Could we have in front of US Amendment number four proposed by Councilmember Burgess and seconded by Councilmember Herbold? There's an even further discussion before I take a vote. I just have a quick question. Councilmember Gonzales. We've heard in the hundreds of emails that I think we've it's fair to say that we've all received on this issue on both sides of the question here. One of the things that gets highlighted is this issue around limited resources. And my understanding of how this money can be used is that, yes, we do have we do have we are a city of limited financial resources. But but your amendment amendment number four and doesn't permit repurposing of those dollars. Is that is that accurate? Amendment. Number four does not originally repurpose the dollars. It keeps them subject to the proviso if provisos are followed. I might add, unless the public private partnership is not established by the end of 2016, then the funds are released to start for pedestrian and bicycle safety improvement projects. If the full amount is not met. And if the full amount is not needed, they would go to that purpose. So these are street use funds. So they will unless the council were to take some different action, they will always be used for street pedestrian, bicycle, vehicle safety improvement type measures. And further to note, there is no use. To just be recognized. Councilmember Heard, what was that conversation with Councilmember Herbold? Correct. Thank you. There are also no limits to the number of federal and state dollars that could go into a public private partnership bike share program. Under amendment number. Four. Any further questions? Council Member Alice. I do not. Thank you. Okay. I think we're ready for a vote. So it's been, um, amendment four has been moved. And second, and all those in favor of the amendment please signify by saying I and raising your hand I. All those opposed signatures saying no one raising your hand? Nope. Okay. So the amendment fails. Are there any other amendments? Yes, Councilmember O'Brien. So I would propose in my paperwork right here. Amendment number five. I'll speak to it and then move it. This amendment would modify section two of the bill. That section already states that the Senate, the Council states its intent to grant authority to lift the proviso on the remaining $3.6 million only after Scott provides a detailed spending and implementation plan. This amendment would add language that adds to that condition that we would lift. The proviso on the expansion after our start also demonstrates that the following bicycle infrastructure projects are on schedule to be completed before sorry, prior to an expansion of the bike share system. And then it lists five protected bike lane projects, one of which is already under construction, and the other four which have been completed design and are in the pipeline ready to go. My understanding is these would need to be completed within the next year. And in conversations with our start, they believe that they can achieve that. So I would move amendment number five. It's been moved and Second Amendment number five, it moved in second. And any further comments or questions? Okay. Hearing then all those in favor of amendment number five. Please signify with saying I and raising your hand. I opposed. The ayes have it. Next amendment. Councilmember O'Brien. So to stick with going in order of the ones that I think are coming forward, I'm actually defer to Councilmember Gonzalez and I believe amendment number seven. Sure. I think you have an amendment number six. But if you want to do six or nine together, I'm happy I'm. Not going to bring six forward and bring nine forward instead, which incorporates the former six. Councilmember Johnson. So Councilmember six is put away and Councilmember Gonzalez will address number seven. Correct? Okay. Thank you. I am proposing amendment number seven, the council bill 118618 as amended. This this amendment has would revise two existing sections and would add a new section, section six revised section one would provide that the Seattle Department of Transportation would be required to use up to $50,000 of the proviso money for outreach activities, as described in Section six of my proposed amendment, which would require the Seattle Department of Transportation Section six new Section six would be entitled Engage Low Income Populations and Communities of Color. Consult with Seattle Office for Civil Rights Section. The new proposed Section six would require the Seattle Department of Transportation to engage low income populations and communities of color on the need for an expansion of the bike share system to serve those communities, as is instructed to do so in consultation with the Office for Civil Rights, which would be consistent with our city's commitment to the racial equity toolkit in the course of their development of an outreach plan that will be both linguistically appropriate and culturally competent and will include surveys and direct public engagement. It also authorizes Scott to engage community based organizations to assist in those community outreach aspects that relate to low income populations and communities of color and imposes a requirement on that to report those findings to council as required by SNC 5.09.040 no later than September 30th, 2016. A Section two simply modifies the number of the proviso from 3.6 to 3550000 to recognize the need to allocate with an existing proviso money. The $50,000 allocated in my amendment for purposes of doing this outreach activity and this particular piece is incredibly important to me. I discussed it in the council briefing this morning at 930. And essentially, I think what we hear a lot from from advocates in this particular area is that this would were this type of publicly funded bike share program would assist low income communities and communities of color. But I have not seen any data or study or analysis that supports that particular claim. And if we are going to move forward with a publicly funded bike share program, I think it is our obligation to engage those impacted communities, to set up a bike share program that clearly identifies the needs of those communities, and that sets up a bike share program that takes into account the multiple barriers to being able to access effectively and meaningfully a bike share program. So this this is the intent behind my particular amendment. And I also intend for it to apply citywide for all low income communities and communities of color that that may live in any area within the city of Seattle and not just restricted to one particular district. So with that being said, I'm happy to answer any questions, but would also entertain a second to this amendment. Okay. Okay. It's been moved in. Second Amendment number seven has been moved in second by our colleagues. Are there any further questions? I have Councilmember O'Brien. I want to thank Councilmember Gonzales for this amendment. I fully support it. And I think she spoke well to the concerns that we need to address going forward. I fundamentally believe that bikeshare system, as I mentioned before, is can be a successful, integral part of our public transit operation in the city. And to do that, it needs to work for all folks in Seattle. And I specifically appreciate you identifying not just in certain neighborhoods. Well, the bike system will most likely be located in starting in certain neighborhoods. And the idea is that folks are coming into the city or from other parts of the city using transit can get off transit and use the bike share for that last connection to their job. And so even though the stations may not be located in your neighborhood, they can really add to the mobility folks have. It's critically important that we understand the unique needs of different individuals in the community. Things like folks may not have credit cards, which can be a barrier to accessing the system in addition to just the cost of it. The training that's needed to make sure you understand how the system works, the location, the the rate schedule, all those things I think are appropriate for us to be looking at and modifying, if necessary, to make sure we have a system that works for everyone. So I will support this and thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez. Councilmember Suarez. Thank you. First of all, I'd like to thank Councilmember Gonzalez and O'Brien. They we discussed some of the changes that we'd like to see going forward. I also want to correct myself this morning. I said that there were no stations north of the ship canal and I was wrong. There are no stations in District five. There is in the University District. But I want to go back to and just reiterate for some of you who weren't here this morning that I shared that in the contract with Pronto and Motivate. One of the issues is because we did accept federal dollars, we have to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And in that, it's really important. And I want to follow up on what Councilmember Gonzalez said. Is that not first of all, not everybody can ride a bike, but there's our communities where they have been overlooked and underserved. And of course, I'm speaking to some neighborhoods in the north. I'm concerned that there are neighborhoods that we are not going to see the kind of geographical diversity that we would like to see in a true bike sharing plan that is equity, that is equitable. I want to commend the former council for moving forward with this. Seattle is a bike city and so I want to look forward in that this new hopefully if we pass this will the city council will have more control with the RFP, with operations, with implementation, with expansion. And so some of us new council people get an opportunity to, if you will, have a second bite at the apple to make this a better program, to be more inclusive and to look at neighborhoods that haven't been served. And so with that, I want to thank the former council and some of the council members here today that brought forward these changes. And so we could also look at them through a social injustice lens. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Worse comes from infectious. You get hunched up. Thinking. Something back shot. Thank you very much, sir. I also want to recognize and thank people that have been working on this, including many who are in the audience. Seattle Neighborhood Greenways, for example, has been reaching out to every neighborhood, both on pedestrian and bicycle connections to make sure that we're a city where everybody can get around. And I'd also like to focus on the idea of all ages and abilities. It isn't simply that various neighborhoods or particular ethnic groups may have been left out. We really want to make sure that people like me, who's currently and riding an e-bike, that we're able to get around and that we feel safe as well. And this is where I also want to thank the Seattle Bicycle Advisory Board. Thank you, Kristie, for being here and speaking to that. I do see that as we are supporting and developing this bike share program. We're not there yet. We all know that. But we have a start and a foundation on which we can build. And it's part of this growing an integrated transportation system in every neighborhood for every age and ability. So thank you and I'll be supporting this. Okay. So I think that exhausts our comments on the amendment number seven. And is there any further comments, all those in favor of amendment number seven, vote I and raise your hand. I opposed the ayes have it. Are there any further amendments? I believe there's one last amendment. Councilmember O'Brien. I would like to move amendment number nine. You shouldn't have this paper in front of you. This would revise Section four. It currently reads that it will incorporate feedback from the Council in developing the request for proposals for expansion for the bike share system. This amendment would add language that says including the possibility of a combined free floating and point to point model deployment of electric bikes and expanding the existing system. It is the Council's intention that the Mayor engage the Council in the selection of the future bike share operator for the bike share RFP prior to any council action to lift the proviso on the remaining 3.4 million. But it should now read 3.55 million for expansion. And then it strikes the last part that was previously, which also referred to council working with the mayor. Second Amendment number nine has been moved in seconds. Are there any further comments or questions? Let me just speak to the two things that this one does, just so the public can track what I just read there. The first is it just highlights, as we talked about earlier, three different models that we may use an expansion, the existing model, an e-bike or electric assist bike model or a point to point. It doesn't restrict any proposals to those three, but those are the three that have been identified to this point. It also makes tries to clarify that the ultimate decision on who will be operating a bike share system under expansion is a decision to be made by the mayor in consultation with the council. And the council, of course, has ultimate authority to lift that proviso. So nothing will be done until it comes to a vote of us. But we're trying to stake out that we want to be working collaboratively, and this decision is a decision made at the elected level. Councilmember, I may ask you a question in recent. Articles in news reports. There have been at least concerns or allegations about conflicts of interest between department officials and how the city has gone about evaluating the Pronto arrangement. You know, there's been a few articles there. Does this. Amendment in any way sort of address some of those concerns, at least given some of the allegations made. In the comments and believe have been in the press have been related to the director of Hastert's previous employment with the company that this predecessor operated and continues to operate the the bikeshare system. But this is trying to make clear is that the decision of selecting for that RFP going forward, which may include people that bid from that company, is not a decision at the discretion of the stock director. Rather, it's going to be a decision made by the mayor in consultation with the council. So it is an attempt to address those concerns. Thank you very much. Are there any other questions on amendment number nine before we take a vote? I just have a clarifying because I'm changing that number from 3.4 to 3.55 to reflect the math. Is that something that we can do or do I need to change rules? Okay. So we'll get that back. Okay. So I think we're ready to vote. Amendment number nine has been moved. And second and all those in favor vote i. I. Opposed. Vote no. The ayes have it. Does that conclude all of our amendments? I think we're ready to vote on the base legislation. I have to move that. You know, it doesn't have to be actually move because it's already it went through committee so we could vote on it. Before I do ask for a vote, are there any further closing comments on the Bass legislation as amended? When I have a single Council member back, Southern Council member Johnson. Great. Just one quick one. And that is that I know over the last few weeks there's been a tremendous amount of heat around this particular legislation. Councilmember Gonzales brought it up. We have received hundreds of emails from people, both pro and con. And what I really hope we can do is rather than having just the heat to provide the light on the issues and the questions on why we want this, why we're moving forward, and I do really want to reduce the angst between drivers and pedestrians and people who are driving trucks or busses. There's this is an opportunity for us to really integrate our system both downtown and across the city. And I think our center city mobility plan that's going to promote a real integrated and yet separated bike lanes and better pedestrian connection so everybody can get around in our city, whether they're driving, whether they're driving a truck or driving a bus. For those that are taking them, this is needed. And to have a bikeshare program that works is something that will just contribute to our transportation system. So I appreciate this. I appreciate the support that my colleagues have given. I recognize what Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Burgess were doing to make sure that this is an effective and efficient system. And I look forward to working with Scott to make sure that we've achieved what all we were speaking about today. So I'll be voting yes. Councilmember Johnson. You know, I, too, want to echo what Councilmember Baxter said. I'll be voting yes today. I fundamentally believe that with public support, I think bike share is going to expand, increase membership and really continue to be an integral part of our city's transportation network. I want to point out, in contrast to my colleague about optimism bias that we as a society spend a lot of time and energy subsidizing our transportation network. We bail out the auto industry. We bail out the airline industry. We bail out all kinds of different private entities in the in the transportation space. We make significant investments in our public transit infrastructure because we see transportation as a critically important part of the public good. And so for me, I think that this is a modest investment to allow us to really move forward on a system that we know is going to work well for people. And I really want to say how much I welcome the opportunity for us to really move forward on a stronger protected bike network. I think that that has got to be really hand in glove with the investment that we're making today, as well as the potential expansion. I fundamentally believe that a bike lane is only a bike lane when it's safe enough for an eight year old to ride in it. And that means that when I think about the vision for the future of our city, it's a place where my little five year old daughters can learn how to ride a bike, not just in the on the ports in our backyard, but also safely on our city streets and a place that they feel safe and that I feel safe. I think that Pronto is going to be very successful system once we have the opportunity to expand that system. And I encourage my colleagues to vote yesterday. I wanted to thank Councilmember Burgess and Council Member Herbold for bringing the issues you did raise that. We need that kind of in this case, minority opinion, but this kind of opinion to make sure we're making wise investments and that it goes through the kind of scrutiny that you require the council to go through. And even though we opted to go a different direction, I think it was a very exhaustive discussion. And I want to thank you for both your committee discussion, your amendments and the discussion today. Having said that, please call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended. Gonzalez, I. Herbold Ney Johnson, I. Or is. Yeah. I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you. O'BRIEN All right. Frances Bagshaw, I. Burgess No. President Harrell I seven in favor to oppose.

{"input": "11 Eyes Council Bill 20 1-0939 has passed. Thank you, Fran. I we'll go ahead and move to our second hearing. Councilmember Sawyer, will you please put Council Bill 944 on the floor for final passage? I move that council bill 21 does 0944 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Thank you. It's been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 944 is open. May we have the staff report? Hi, certainly. Good evening, council. I'm Brandon Shaver, senior city planner CPD presenting an official map application for 1901 West Street, 1600 and 20th Street and 1601 19th Street, requesting a rezoning from Pdg 19 to Pdg 26. As this request is a party to city rezoning and is closely linked to an approved, comprehensive signed plan and a forthcoming comprehensive site plan Amendment staff found it important to highlight the following. The current PD G 19 was adopted in November 2018, and the current comprehensive site plan, or CSP, was approved in December of 2020. Comprehensive signed plans allow for flexibility in same types, same area and same location, more so than can be achieved through the regular sign regulations in Article ten of the Denver Zoning Code. This flexibility is offered in exchange for a higher degree of design and use of high quality materials and require enhanced review by staff and other design professionals depending on where the project is located in the city. In this case, the Comprehensive Signage Plan was reviewed by Landmark Preservation Staff to ensure compatibility with the abutting historic district. All elements of PD G 19 are proposed to be carried forward and the new PD, including the design standards and Guidelines and includes the inclusion of two unique signs in the current Comprehensive Sign Plan, with allowances for animation and limited offsite advertising varying between the types. These types include the Content Plaza, canopy screen and the open space area and dynamic banner ground signs along the Wynkoop Promenade. As I mentioned, a forthcoming comprehensive site plan amendment is anticipated to go in from the planning board and then on to the zoning administrator in the coming weeks . And they will provide more detail on the public art and screen component, which could include a design review board or design board and a nonprofit organizations to use for curation, as well as a reporting mechanism to demonstrate compliance with the duty and mitigate any potential negative impacts. As some councilmembers may have noticed of the dynamic vendor, ground science and content plaza canopies screen are currently in operation on the site from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.. This was due to the applicant's request to activate Configure Square in advance of and during the All-Star Game events that occurred in July. They were also granted a variance by the Board of Adjustment on July 13th to extend the temporary use permit and continue operation of these sites. There are other areas and districts in the city where these special site allowances are granted. These include the downtown Denver Theater District and Station, the National Western Center and the Billboard Use Overlay. In many of these instances, a planning document was adopted by council that spoke directly to the desire to allow special signage. The requirements and restrictions tied to these allowances can be found in the respective sections of the Denver Zoning Code. There are a number of considerations that were taken into account and staff reviewed this request. These include the unique, unique site configuration. And Jason has previously mentioned the fact that the subject site is on one's own, not that the billboard use overlay cannot be mapped where it does not currently exist and the public benefits provided by this party request. Now moving on to the requests, it's in Council District nine, represented by Councilwoman CdeBaca in the Union Station disco neighborhood . As previously mentioned, current zoning on the site is June 19 and there are a number of zoning designations surrounding the subject site, including eight, which is light industrial at Coors Field, IMX eight to the northwest, lower downtown zoning across 19 Emwazi streets and pads to the west and southwest. Again. Pdg 19, was approved in late 2018. It is based on the DA's 12 plus zone district, which can be found a few blocks to the north and east and at a high level. This PD provides a tailored building forms of private open space requirement and a parking maximum. Existing land use on the site is shown as vacant as this data was last compiled before construction of McGregor Square had commenced. When updated, the site would show a mix of uses including commercial, retail, multi-unit, residential and mixed use in office. Surrounding land uses include mixed use multi-unit residential across the Wynkoop Promenade and 19th streets, office entertainment, cultural land use at Coors Field and vacant land uses to the east of the site. These photos give you a sense of the building, form and scale on the area with the subject property and the wynkoop promenade under construction at the top left. And the photo on the bottom right is an example of the historic context in which the subject property is adjacent to. As previously stated, this party request would formalize the inclusion of two unique sign types across the site, each with their own minimum percentages of public art and screen share. These same types would allow for animation and limited offsite advertising, with further restrictions on signs within 50 feet of the lower downtown historic district to respect the character and minimize impacts for drivers along Wynkoop Street. Additionally, the Pudi outlines and enhanced CSP requirements at the site that would provide more guidance on the public art and screen share component and contain a reporting mechanism to demonstrate compliance with the duty and mitigate any negative impacts should they arise in the future. Informational notice of this application was sent in early March and the Planning Board public hearing was continued on July 21st to August 18th to allow the applicant team to respond to questions raised by the board . Notice of today's meeting was sent on September 20th and as a present to comments and received a letter of support and position. Letter for the party were received by the LoDo District R.A., as well as a letter from the condo building across Wynkoop Promenade supporting the extension of the temporary use permit. So based on the comments received at the July 21st planning board hearing here you can see the changes that the applicant made to their proposal, and ultimately it was recommended for approval on an 8 to 1 vote at the August 18th meeting. I'll quickly go through the first five criteria, beginning with consistency, with adopted plans. We have four plans for land use guidance here. We find this request to be consistent with many of the strategies and plan 2040. So I move directly to Blueprint, which maps this as a downtown neighborhood context. This is the densest and most active context in our city that gives prominence to the pedestrian realm. And this joining requests as it's based on a downtown district is consistent with the context map, the featured places map designates. This is a regional center. These places have the widest customer draw and provide a 24 seven live work and play environment. This rezoning request is consistent with the future place designation as it creates an environment for an active and lively pedestrian experience with urban building forms. Four Street types, both 19th NYC are classified as downtown arterials. These streets are surrounded by intense land uses and have a very high degree of building coverage which also cater to pedestrians. 20th Street, at the northern edge of the property, is a mixed use arterial, which is also characterized by a varied mix of land uses and multistory buildings with continuous building frontages. The requested property district is consistent with these street types because it allows for a variety of land uses at an intense scale focused around pedestrians. For Growth area strategy. Regional centers are anticipated to absorb 50% of new jobs and 30% of new housing by 2040. The proposed party allows for housing and job opportunities consistent with this plan direction. We also have additional recommendations from Blueprint that speak to updating or assigned code regulations to recognize changing technologies and limiting the use of custom zoning. In this case, a standard zone district does not exist to implement adaptive plans. Thus, custom zoning through the use of the PD was found to be appropriate and supported by CPD staff. Moving to the downtown area, a plan which was adopted in 2011. This plan has key recommendations relevant to the site. It calls for prioritizing pedestrians through the encouragement of housing and active ground floors. It also promotes enhancing the public realm and providing venues for outdoor activity while transitioning appropriately to the lower downtown historic district. The proposed PDE, with its high floor for heights, transition and building height special attention to the Wynkoop Promenade and private open space agreement is consistent with the downtown area plan. Next we have the Central Valley Comprehensive Plan Amendment from 1991. This guides the redevelopment of the Valley into a neighborhood with a mix of uses, open space and pedestrian network, strong connections to downtown, and a unique character that complements downtown. The subject site is identified as general mixed use, which includes office, retail, housing, entertainment and hotel, while specifically stating that light industrial uses are not allowed. The plan recommends mid-rise building heights as appropriate for this area and that the building index or the planned index should consider. The steering committee assumed a height of about 140 feet for these mid-rise areas. Here you can see the plan also identifies a primary pedestrian route across the site at the location of the current Wynkoop Promenade. Lastly, the plan identifies the site as being within the plan's sub area, which includes specific guidance that lower downtown's scale and character should set a precedent for the scale and quality of future development in pedestrian and bicycle access should be provided. It also calls for a small, open public space, and that development on the site should strengthen Moto's mix of uses. Therefore, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the CPV plant amendment as it will result in uses consistent with the plan. Facilitate compatible building form and design. Allow building heights that are generally consistent with the mid-rise height guidance. Provide an enhanced pedestrian connection recommended in the plan and provide open space coupled with design standards and guidelines that will ensure quality compatible development. Moving for the next two criteria. The rezoning would result in the uniform application of zoned district building form, use and design regulations, with the PD being based on a downtown zone district. It would also protect the public health, safety and welfare through implementing adopted plans and requiring enhanced design standards, open space amenities and custom sign regulations to mitigate negative impacts to surrounding properties. Significant development and redevelopment in and around the Union Station neighborhood, coupled with the city adapted plans that call for enhanced pedestrian amenities in downtown areas, serve as appropriate justifying circumstances. This rezoning is also consistent with the neighborhood context zone, district purpose and intent statements as it uses the 12 plus as a base with tailoring to ensure compatibility. There are also five additional PD specific review criteria that apply to this case. To begin, this PD is consistent with the intent and purpose of such districts as a customized approach is needed to address the unique downtown location while respecting the immediate historic context. Similarly, the beauty is not intended as a vehicle to develop the site and consistent with the surrounding contexts or to enhance economic feasibility as it is based on the downtown neighborhood context and is intended as a mechanism to ensure development is consistent with what adopted plans call for. The party must also create significant public benefit. These benefits include. The inclusion of public art, opportunities for family friendly events and private open space with within urban building forms. The rezoning also meets the next three specific criteria as it complies with the Vision 9.6. There is no standard zone district available to apply downtown appropriate science standards to address the uniqueness of the site, but that multiple variances waivers were conditions and the pre establishes permitted uses that are compatible and the same as the Ds220+ Zone District on which it is based. The party is also consistent with the last criterion, as it provides customization largely based on existing building forms found in the zoning code and incorporates design standards and guidelines based on those proposed square that are tailored to address adjacency to lower downtown, the Wynkoop Promenade and the private open space requirement. With that, CPD staff recommends approval of this rezoning request, finding that all ten review criteria have been met. That concludes this presentation and team is present in person if you have questions. All right. Thank you, Brandon. And this evening, we have seven individuals that signed up to speak. Our first three speakers are going to be in person. And so first up, we have Sean Maley. Signed up to answer questions. So I have only answers to questions if you have them. Thank you so much. All right. Very good. Thank you, Sean. Next up, we have John Young, new SKUs. So, you see. I might have missed pronounce it. I'll let you go ahead and correct me, sir. Thank you. It's Joni on a shoe ski, and I'm here just to answer questions. All right, very good. Our next speaker is Hal Roth. Good evening, Madam President and council members. I'm here to speak. So I'm Helle Roth with the West Flight LLC, the developer of the Gregor Square 2001 Blake Street, Denver. We're delighted to be before you tonight with an amendment to our PWD MacGregor Square that will complete the activation and placemaking for the over 50,000 square feet of open space that is accessible to the public. As you heard in the staff report, the purpose of this piece is to allow for specific types of signage, mainly video, which are appropriate in a downtown outdoor plaza context. Nearly all the signs are internal to the site, which serve to activate the 30% of open space on the site, enhance the pedestrian and events experience, and provide public benefits to arts, local nonprofits and small businesses. These signs were always part of our project and the design for the Content Plaza and were included in all of the presentations and renderings that we presented to you back in 2018. Since that approval, we continue to work with the city on our comprehensive sign plan and were informed in July of 2019 that we needed to amend the period to have video. We have been working with the city ever since on this amended PD and the related CSP. The video features are designed to attract people, their families, children and events to the plaza and enhance the widen the walkway or promenade, as Brandon referred to it, and are part of the 50 to 80 trail. We will also display a significant amount of art and have a screen share component to promote local nonprofits, public messaging and local small business all at no charge. The content for these elements will be helped by an advisory board, which will include representatives from the neighborhood, arts and nonprofit communities. We have also discussed partnerships with local art schools. The broader public benefits associated with McGregor Square include transforming an old parking lot into a redevelopment that will provide $125 million for capital improvements over 30 years for Coors Field, at no cost to the city or the taxpayers and a larger generation of sales, private lodging and property tax revenue to the city. We'd like to thank the city staff who have spent countless hours with us on this project, as well as all the community groups and our closest adjacent neighbors for their input and support in this process. This is truly a project where all the collaboration with the neighborhood made the project what it is today and much better than when we started. Thank you. And we are available for questions. All right. Thank you very much. The rest of our speakers are joining us online. And I have next David Tweed. And so, David, if you could please raise your hand. We'll. Move you over to make sure you can. Share your comments with us. Okay. Go ahead, David. I'm just here to answer questions as necessary. All right. Thank you. Next up, we have Caroline White. Madam Chair, I am. Also here to answer questions. All right. Thank you. And then we have Rick, Nina, man. Go ahead, Rick. Good evening. My name is Rick Denman. I live at 1735 19th Street. I'm the board president for one Wynkoop Plaza. Essentially, our front door opens directly onto the winter walkway and faces directly at the Rally Hotel at McGregor Square. I wanted to attend today to again share why the LoDo condominium community supports the proposed zoning change at seven 1901 wasI. And to give kudos to my neighbors at McGregor Square for everything they've done and how great they've worked with us throughout the planning, construction and the operation of the development. The leadership of McGregor Square and the Rockies have communicated with residents and local businesses so as not to create undue or unforeseen problems. Naturally, with a project of this scope and magnitude, things come up. But I must share that these items were dealt with quickly and professionally and with good follow up communication. One Wynkoop Plaza, the LoDo and Ballpark communities were engaged in meetings and dialog right from the very start, including the acceptance of proposals from developers prior to the Rockies taking this project in-house. The project team told us exactly what was going to happen and when they listened to our concerns and actually made some changes so as not to create problems for us and other neighbors down the road. Following the construction, which we all survived, thankfully, we are still speaking to one another and prior to the opening of McGregor Square, residents were extremely concerned. What we could expect from the operation of such a large development prior to the opening, the McGregor Square leadership at giving us guidelines about operations and curfews on lighting, sound, live events and use of what I call the Jumbotron. I must say that our residents are very pleased with the McGregor Square team as they have more than lived up to their commitment to Curfew's noise and light and disruption. I can't imagine how we could have been more open and had better communication and responsiveness from our neighbors across the walkway. The long term benefits of having an urban resort out our front door far outweighs some of the dust and disruption we experienced during the build. Like so many other redeveloped urban communities around the country, this project brings new vibrancy to LoDo and downtown. It makes our city more of a destination spot. I regularly get asked while on my daily walks past Union Station, How does how do I find McGregor Square, which is the way to McGregor Square? The triad of Coors Field, Union Station and McGregor Square truly are the crown jewels of downtown Denver. Thank you very much. And thank you for your service to our community. Thank you. Our last speaker we have is Fabio Hilliard. And it doesn't seem like we have had Fabio joining us online and not in chambers. And so that's going to conclude our speakers this evening. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 944. Councilmember Hines. Thank you. Council President. I also want to thank CBD for the presentation. I thank you the applicants for for being here tonight. I agree with with CBD. This is the core of the urban core and the density should be here. I also want to agree with the the plans that have been adopted as far back as the CPV plan in 1991 about how this should prioritize pedestrians and cyclists. So further, I want to thank Mr. Roth for acknowledging the 50 to 80 trail. It's very important to me and I and I think I think it will be transformative for our city center. I've heard that this location has a little bit of a hiccup. And so regarding the 50 to 80 trail. And so I wanted to ask if perhaps I'm inaccurate. So if I could ask either Mr. Roth or one of the applicants to the the question that I heard, the the hiccup that I've heard is that cyclists, as they go by in McGregor Square, will be required to dismount, even if it's along the 50 to 80 trail , which is somewhat counter to the intent of the trail. And I just, you know, since. Since there is a bit of a transformative project just like this is. Perhaps I'm incorrect, but if someone could answer that question, that'd be great. Thank you. Skip. Thank you, Councilman. We have during games when there's heavy pedestrian traffic. Ask bicyclists to dismount for safety reasons. Now, if there are games or events going on, that's certainly something we can look at to to allow that. We would hope a bicyclist, though, would realize they need to be at a slow speed going through there. Oh, and during games that totally make sense. I mean, I've been to a game there. I'm sure that pretty much everyone who's watching this has as well. And, and it is probably unsafe for cyclists to be there in such a pedestrian friendly area outside of games. I, I just want to make sure that, that we are willing to take a look at the trail. The, the trail is not really meant to be a, a place for speed racers. It's really meant to be more of a community building trail. And so I would hope that cyclists would be at a slow speed throughout the trail. And if people are really intending to use commuting speeds, they would use other, other avenues. But but I want to. I guess I just ask you, you're willing to take another look at the the dismounting during non-game times? Yes, absolutely. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Council president. Thank you. Councilmember Hines. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 944. All right. Not seen any. I'll go ahead and chime in, seeing that this does meet all of the criteria as presented. Happy to support it this evening and ask my colleagues to do so as well. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 944. All. I work. I climb. I flinch. I tendons. I. Cashmere. I can eat. I. Ortega. Sawyer, i. Madam President. I.

The staff presentation will be made by Amy Bodak, our Director of Development Services. Mr. Mayor, members of the City Council tonight before you is essentially a cleanup item of our municipal code as it relates to various definitions that comprise our housing definitions. We have a couple of housing definitions in the code that are severely outdated and that need to be updated. We also need to change some of our definitions to comply with current state housing law, and those definitions have been included in your staff report. We are essentially. Asking you to add four definitions to the municipal code supportive housing, target population, transitional housing and single room occupancy. And then we're also asking you to revise the existing definition of a family that we can have in our municipal code, because it, frankly, is an antiquated. We did take this information to the Planning Commission, and the Planning Commission did approve this request in April, provided that you approve this request. Also, we would submit it to the Coastal Commission for their update as well and then revise the municipal code. That concludes my staff report. I'm here if. You have any questions.

{"input": "I emotion carries. Thank you. Next item is hearing 32. Or hearing. A lecture. Report from Development Services recommendation, receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing. Declare Ordinance Amending Title 21 Zoning Regulations of the Long Beach Municipal Code. An ordinance amending and restating the Douglas Park Plan Development District. Read the first time and later the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading and adopt a resolution to submit the ordinance amendments to the California Coastal Commission citywide. Okay. Let me turn this over to staff. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We'll have a staff report from Christopher Koontz. Good evening again, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council. What I'm going to do is go through a brief verbal summary of this item and then at the request of any council member, we also do have a more extended PowerPoint presentation, if so, to start, but to do the short summary. The city zoning code has not been comprehensively updated for more than 30 years, and because of this complex and outdated provisions exist throughout the code, the Planning Bureau conducts periodic tune ups to modernize and improve the readability of the city zoning code. That is the item that is before you. This evening, Staff has prepared a series of code amendments that address land use shoes and improve administrative processes. All of the items before you were noncontroversial. When approved by the Planning Commission on February 20th, 2020, I'm going to go through the changes themselves to the zoning code. There are eight. The first we have a zone C0 and C eight that have been eliminated, but there are still references to in the code this resolves that issue. The second is we have inconsistency in our industrial and commercial zones as to where personal storage can be located. That's a restricted use because it does not result in benefits to the city. And this clarifies that the third change is the largest change and I think most important change this evening, which is to allow aerospace, rocketry and space type uses to those type of manufacturers to exist in our industrial areas, including throughout the city. As a matter of right. These are uses that we lost over time, that when the defense industry and the aerospace industry left the city and we redeveloped the Boeing property as Douglas Park, the whole idea then was to replace those missing jobs. But we are the beneficiary of many new high technology rocketry and aerospace uses coming back, and this will provide greater flexibility to those uses to open up, make improvements and operate in the city. The fourth change allows temporary uses that are community serving to exist on vacant lots. The city has a vacant lot registry and fee program and we do allow vacant lots that commit themselves to some public purpose. Be that a location for a crop swap or community gathering or a bike repair station, any use that would be in partnership with the city on that vacant lot to exempt themselves from the fee. And this would make a corresponding change to the zoning code to allow those uses on a temporary basis. Number five eliminates prohibitions on storage, attics and accessory structures throughout the city. One of our strategies to improve parking shortages is to make sure that garages are usable by cars, not just by stuff that people accumulate. And this will allow greater opportunities to have storage areas, including in attics. Number six would allow our partners at Cal State, Long Beach and City College to operate satellite, publicly run uses within existing storefronts and buildings in the city and providing them a limited exemption from change of use parking requirements. Number seven clarifies that if you put up a fabric awning or some type of shade structure, that that's not a height violation and that provide some additional flexibility to property owners to not be in an enforcement situation by trying to have shade during the summer heat. And the final item to clarify is that when we do make changes like this and the zoning code, how those apply to our different what we call plan development districts and specific plans throughout the city, and that allows us to have a process going forward to continue making these changes to the code. And with that, I'm glad to answer any questions or if there were extensive questions that any council member wanted, the extended presentation that is also available. Think I have a motion by Councilwoman Mango. Can I get a second, please? Taken by Councilmember Pierce. Councilman Mongo, any questions? Not before was storage, I think. Hello. Something that was in the presentation that was new to me was storage. I don't think I had understood that this property would allow for storage. I thought we were adding the station, not storage. Council member, there were two issues related to storage. The city is very restrictive about where commercial storage, such as self storage, is located. There's no changes being made to that. It's just clarifying that use and using those words self storage, public storage, commercial storage within the zoning code instead of using what's called an SCC code which has led to confusion. So that was one change. And then the other change had to do with on residential properties, allowing attics on accessory structures. Right now you can have an attic in your single family home, you can have an attic over your garage if your garage is attached to your home. But if you have a detached garage, which most of the historic properties, most of the homes in Long Beach do have detached garages. Right now, you can't have an attic over that garage. This would allow you to have that attic, which gives homeowners an opportunity to store more stuff above their garage and put their car hopefully within the garage. So those were the two items dealing with storage. Well, you know, I'm always supportive of people parking garages. And as long as we weren't saying that the commercial properties would be allowed for self-storage, then I'm very supportive of that and I continue to make the motion. Thank you. Thank you. Counsel under the motion that can be council member Pearson. Any comments? Yes, thank you. I think that all of these changes are great. Glad to hear that they made them through planning without any issue. I did want to take the opportunity to ask a question about the process for other changes to our code and zoning. As we know, parking is extremely expensive for developers. We also know that the state has basically said that cities are allowed to make changes that allow for us to count one eve parking spot as two parking spots. And I'm wondering what the process is, because I know we've talked about this the last six months with staff. Would I need to bring an item forward or is that something that we could direct you to do today, to explore and see what you know, see if that's a good route? All right, Councilmember, you would not have to bring a separate item if you or the whole of the council want to give that direction to the city manager. We'd be glad to absorb that into our work program, I think, if we were going to tackle that issue. There's also our issue on our that we need to address at some point having to do with bike parking and whether you can buy a very small amount reduce here required vehicle parking if you put in extra bicycle parking. All of that would have to go through a public process and the Planning Commission process. But if that if the Council would like us to put that on our to do list, we'd be glad to do that. I would love to include in this motion directing staff to do a report on parking and the changes that need to be made to code to allow for more EV stations to be installed citywide. If that is acceptable by the first motion. Ah, that would be wonderful. I'm sorry, Mango. Councilwoman Mango. I unmuted and said, sure. Can you hear me now? Yes. Hello. The next up is Governor Richardson. Any comments? No, that was the second. Okay, great. Then let me go ahead and do a roll call vote. District one. I. District two. Art District three.
